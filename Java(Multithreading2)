1) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?
    The Thread can be created by using two ways.
    By extending the Thread class
    By implementing the Runnable interface
    However, the primary differences between both the ways are given below:
                By extending the Thread class, we cannot extend any other class, as Java does not allow multiple inheritances while implementing the Runnable interface; we can also extend other base class(if required).
                By extending the Thread class, each of thread creates the unique object and associates with it while implementing the Runnable interface; multiple threads share the same object
                Thread class provides various inbuilt methods such as getPriority(), isAlive and many more while the Runnable interface provides a single method, i.e., run().

2) What does join() method?
    The join() method waits for a thread to die. In other words, it causes the currently running threads to stop executing until the thread it joins with completes its task. Join method is overloaded in Thread class in the following ways.
    public void join()throws InterruptedException
    public void join(long milliseconds)throws InterruptedException

3) Describe the purpose and working of sleep() method.
    The sleep() method in java is used to block a thread for a particular time, which means it pause the execution of a thread for a specific time. There are two methods of doing so.
    Syntax:
        public static void sleep(long milliseconds)throws InterruptedException
        public static void sleep(long milliseconds, int nanos)throws InterruptedException
        Working of sleep() method
    When we call the sleep() method, it pauses the execution of the current thread for the given time and gives priority to another thread(if available). Moreover, when the waiting time
    completed then again previous thread changes its state from waiting to runnable and comes in running state, and the whole process works so on till the execution doesn't complete.

4) What is the difference between wait() and sleep() method?
    wait()	sleep()
    1) The wait() method is defined in Object class.	The sleep() method is defined in Thread class.
    2) The wait() method releases the lock.	The sleep() method doesn't release the lock.

5) Is it possible to start a thread twice?
No, we cannot restart the thread, as once a thread started and executed, it goes to the Dead state. Therefore, if we try to start a thread twice, it will give a runtimeException "java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException".
