1) Explain the peer-peer process.
The processes on each machine that communicate at a given layer are called peer-peer process.

2) What is a congested switch?
A switch receives packets faster than the shared link. It can accommodate and stores in its memory, for an extended period of time, then the switch will eventually run out of buffer space, and some packets will have to be dropped. This state is called a congested state.

3) What is multiplexing in networking?
In Networking, multiplexing is the set of techniques that is used to allow the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link.

4) What are the advantages of address sharing?
Address sharing provides security benefit instead of routing. That's because host PCs on the Internet can only see the public IP address of the external interface on the computer that provides address translation and not the private IP addresses on the internal network.

5) What is RSA Algorithm?
RSA is short for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm. It is mostly used for public key encryption.
